# BorFIT: Establishing a novel training data set to aid circumboreal AI applications to detect individual trees and species in northern boreal forests and the tundra transition
by Jacob Schladebach & Stefan Kruse

## Project description
BorFIT is a comprehensive training dataset designed to improve the segmentation of individual trees and species detection from LiDAR point clouds in boreal forests. We used a randomForest model to predict the species of trees. Here we compiled the R code used for randomForest model training and prediction.
