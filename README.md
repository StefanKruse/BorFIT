# BorFIT

# Project description
BorFIT is a comprehensive training dataset designed to improve the segmentation of individual trees and species detection from LiDAR point clouds in boreal forests. We used a randomForest model to predict the species of trees. Here we compiled the R code used for randomForest model training and prediction.
